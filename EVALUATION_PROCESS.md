# Faculty Appraisal Evaluation Process

## Overview
The faculty appraisal system implements a multi-stage evaluation process involving faculty members, Heads of Department (HOD), and Deans. The process ensures comprehensive evaluation of faculty performance across multiple criteria and includes mechanisms for feedback and improvement planning.

## Process Flow

### Stage 1: Faculty Achievement Submission
- Faculty members submit their achievements for the appraisal cycle
- Achievements include:
  - Research activities (publications, conferences, etc.)
  - University services (committees, administrative roles)
  - Community services (outreach, professional activities)
  - Teaching activities (courses taught, student evaluations)

### Stage 2: HOD Review and Evaluation
- HOD reviews submitted achievements
- HOD evaluates faculty performance across four main areas:
  - Research (30% weight)
  - University Service (20% weight)
  - Community Service (20% weight)
  - Teaching Quality (30% weight)
- HOD evaluates faculty capabilities using predefined rubrics
- HOD can create/update a Self-Development Plan for the faculty member
- HOD sends scores to Dean for review

### Stage 3: Dean Review and Evaluation
- Dean reviews faculty achievements and HOD evaluation
- Dean can accept, modify, or provide additional evaluation
- Dean evaluates performance and capabilities
- Dean sends final scores to faculty

### Stage 4: Faculty Review and Decision
- Faculty receives evaluation scores and feedback
- Faculty can:
  - **Approve**: Accept the evaluation (status becomes COMPLETE)
  - **Appeal**: Request reconsideration with optional message (status becomes RETURNED)
- If appealed, the evaluation returns to the appropriate evaluator for review

### Stage 5: Appeal Resolution
- Evaluator reviews the appeal and can modify evaluation if needed
- Process returns to Stage 3 or 4 as appropriate
- Final approval completes the appraisal cycle

## Status Flow
- NEW → IN_REVIEW (after HOD initial evaluation)
- IN_REVIEW → SCORES_SENT (after Dean sends scores)
- SCORES_SENT → COMPLETE (faculty approval) or RETURNED (faculty appeal)
- RETURNED → SCORES_SENT (after evaluator review)

## Key Components

### Performance Evaluation
- Research: Publications, citations, research projects
- University Service: Department committees, academic governance
- Community Service: Professional activities, public engagement
- Teaching: Course delivery, student satisfaction, pedagogical innovation

### Capabilities Evaluation
- Professional knowledge and skills
- Teaching effectiveness
- Research capabilities
- Administrative and leadership skills
- Professional development

### Self-Development Plan
- Development areas identification
- Link to organizational goals
- Planned activities and expected results
- Timeframes for completion
- Signatures from HOD and Dean

## Technical Implementation
- Built with Next.js and Prisma
- Database stores evaluations, scores, and metadata
- API endpoints handle workflow transitions
- Role-based access control ensures proper permissions
- Audit trail through signatures and status changes

## Rubrics and Scoring
- Performance criteria use predefined rubrics with point allocations
- Capabilities evaluation uses competency-based rubrics
- Automated score calculation with manual override capability
- Weighted scoring system for final grade determination
